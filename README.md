## Authentication
Authentication is required for certain endpoints to ensure the security and privacy of driver and passenger information. The Taxi API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, include the JWT token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests.

## Error Handling
The Taxi API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for various scenarios. Refer to the API documentation for a comprehensive list of error codes and their meanings.
